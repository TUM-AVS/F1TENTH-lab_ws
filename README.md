# F1TENTH-lab_ws
This repository contains a fully functioning image of all packages necessary for the practical course: "F1TENTH: Autonomous Driving Hands-on" at the Technical University of Munich. The sources for all packages, taken from other repositories, are listed below. This repo simply keeps a codebase safe for us, that works with Jetpack 5.1.2 and our installation instructions found in the other repository: [F1TENTH-Auxiliaries](https://github.com/TUM-AVS/F1TENTH-Auxiliaries.git).
